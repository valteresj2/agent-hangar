# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.17.0] — 2026-10-06

### Added
- **Digital employee, phase F2** ([docs/digital-employee.md](docs/digital-employee.md)).
  - **Routines:** recurring work from a cron. It runs only while the employee is active, never two at once (a run is
    skipped while the previous task is open), and is safe with several central replicas. Routines can be created at
    hire, over MCP (`set_routine`, `list_routines`, `delete_routine`) or in the new *Routines* tab.
  - **Inbound webhook:** `POST /hooks/employees/{slug}` with a per-employee token (shown once, stored hashed,
    rotatable). A `dedupe_key` seen in the last 7 days does not create a second task.
  - **Measured goals:** each KPI can point to a platform metric (`done_rate`, `on_time_rate`,
    `approved_unedited_rate`, `avg_decision_min`, `cost_per_task`, `tasks_done`, `expired_decisions`) with a target.
    The *Overview* shows on/off target.
  - **Weekly report** on a chosen weekday, with each goal compared with its target.
  - **Learning from decisions:**
    - suggests moving an action type from *approve* to *notify* after repeated approvals without edits, never below
      the company floor;
    - turns repeated corrections on one tool into a lesson that goes into every new task's prompt;
    - the manager applies or dismisses each suggestion (*Authority* tab, or `employee_suggestions` /
      `apply_suggestion`).
  - **Growing waits between retries** when a round fails (30 s, 60 s, 120 s…). Migration `0014_employee_f2`.
  - Settings: `EMPLOYEE_RETRY_BASE_S`, `EMPLOYEE_DEDUPE_DAYS`, `LEARN_MIN_APPROVALS`, `LEARN_MIN_CORRECTIONS`.

## [0.16.1] — 2026-10-05

### Fixed
- **Digital employee admission respects the team's four-eyes rule.** Before, the manager's admission published to
  production directly. Now it goes through the normal ship flow: when the team requires approval and the manager
  cannot publish, it opens a promotion request and the employee becomes active only after someone else approves it.
  If you admitted a Digital employee on 0.16.0 in a team that requires approval, check its production version in
  the audit log (`employee.admission.approved`).
- Digital employees hired in English get the task prompt, the runtime instructions and the admission summary in
  English (they followed Portuguese before and sometimes mixed languages in their answers).
- Portal: results of tasks and probation render Markdown, and the action to approve shows each argument on its own
  line (an e-mail reads as it will be sent).

### Changed
- Interactive demo: three new steps for the Digital employee (probation, a decision on the exact e-mail, authority),
  recorded live with a real LLM.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-10-05

### Added
- **Digital employee (phase F1)**: agents hired for a job, with a human manager, an authority level and a task queue
  ([docs/digital-employee.md](docs/digital-employee.md)).
  - Hiring in self mode over MCP: `plan_employee` returns the missing fields with the question for the owner, and
    `hire_employee` creates nothing until the job is complete. The portal has the same flow as a guided form.
  - Lifecycle: onboarding → probation (real tasks in stage) → admission by the manager (ships to production) →
    active ↔ paused → offboarded.
  - Authority enforced by the platform: the runtime calls `POST /internal/gate` before every tool call and fails
    closed. Modes are auto, notify, approve, approve_2 and never; job rules with conditions sit under the autonomy
    level's default and the company floor, and the strictest wins. Tools are classified into an action catalog.
  - Human in the loop: tasks pause on the exact action. Decisions are approve, approve with edits, reject, instruct,
    answer and acknowledge, with separation of duties, two approvers, escalation to a backup and expiry (the action
    is not done). Approvals are one-time grants for that exact payload.
  - Tasks run from checkpoints with a timeline, a budget, a time limit and a round limit.
  - Daily reports in the portal and on a webhook (Slack or Teams, whichever the company uses).
  - Portal: *Digital employees* (list, hire, per-employee tabs) and *Decisions* (inbox with batch decide, badge, home
    card). Console: workforce overview with *Stop all now*, the action catalog and the company floor.
  - API under `/api/employees`, `/api/tasks`, `/api/decisions` and `/api/admin/{workforce,action-catalog,authority-floor}`;
    MCP tools for hiring, tasks, decisions and the lifecycle. Migration `0013_digital_employees`.
  - Settings: `EMPLOYEE_WORKERS`, `EMPLOYEE_MAX_RUNS`, `DECISION_EXPIRES_MIN`.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-10-04

### Added
- **Guide tab for every agent**, between Usage and Playground ([docs/guide.md](docs/guide.md)). It replaces the
  Multi-agent tab.
  - A flow diagram built from the spec. It shows which skills, MCPs, tools, memory, specialists (linked) and
    harness job the agent uses, never their content.
  - A fact sheet. Example requests come from the passed test cases; endpoints are shown only to people who can use
    the agent.
  - A Markdown guide for users: what it is, what it does, what it does not do, how to use it and its limits.
  - The guide text is versioned per agent version but kept outside the spec, so fixing documentation needs no new
    version or tests. The tab warns when the text was written for an older version.
  - When a version reaches production without a guide, the agent's LLM writes a draft from the spec and the passed
    tests only. It is marked "not reviewed" until a maintainer approves it, and it never replaces human text.
    `GUIDE_AUTOGEN=0` turns this off.
  - The first paragraph of a reviewed guide becomes the A2A Agent Card description.
  - API: `GET/PUT /api/agents/{slug}/guide`, `POST .../guide/approve`, `POST .../guide/generate`.
  - MCP: `get_agent_guide`, `set_agent_guide`.
- **The guide is a step of building an agent over MCP.**
  - It is step 7 of the platform instructions, before `ship_agent`.
  - `design_agent`, `compose_agent`, `build_multi_agent` (orchestrator and each member) and `edit_agent` accept
    `guide=` in the same call.
  - Every build tool and `ship_agent` return `guide.written`, with the next step when it is missing.
    `build_multi_agent` lists `guides_missing`.
  - The guide is saved for the version being built. When you edit a live agent, the new text waits for its version
    to be published; the tab shows "a guide for vN is ready".
  - The automatic draft runs only for agents that never had a guide written by a person.
- Comparison with CrewAI AMP, LangSmith Deployment, Dify, AWS Bedrock AgentCore and Microsoft Foundry + Agent 365,
  in both READMEs; details and sources in [docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md)
  ([pt-BR](docs/comparison.pt-BR.md)).
- [docs/cloud-vm.md](docs/cloud-vm.md): install on a cloud VM with Docker on AWS (EC2), Azure (Virtual Machines)
  and Google Cloud (Compute Engine). It covers the VM with SSH open only to you, Docker Engine, the installer and a
  tunnel for HTTPS. Each step links to the provider's documentation.

## [0.14.1] — 2026-10-03

### Added
- **ARM64 images.** Every published image is now multi-architecture (amd64 and arm64), built on native runners:
  Apple Silicon Macs run without emulation, and Kubernetes clusters with ARM nodes (AWS Graviton, Azure Ampere,
  GKE T2A) work.
- `list_agents` (MCP) returns `stage_version` and `prod_version`: the version running in each environment. `status`
  and `version` are the newest version, which can be a draft while production keeps running an older one.
- CI:
  - the installer and the CLI are tested on macOS;
  - a regression check runs a harness job with a workspace owned by another user, as on Kubernetes;
  - responses with a 4xx status on `/mcp` are logged with the JSON-RPC method, the protocol version and the error,
    to diagnose clients without reproducing.

### Fixed
- **Harness jobs on Kubernetes returned no diff.** The workspace volume belongs to root there, and git refused it
  ("dubious ownership"). The harness entrypoint now trusts the workspace for git and for the harness CLIs.

### Verified
- A clean install from the published 0.14.0 images (`install.sh --answers`, inside an isolated Docker) passed the
  end-to-end smoke test (19 checks). This includes the coding-harness extra, which builds the Claude Code image
  locally.
- The 0.14.0 chart, installed from `oci://ghcr.io/valteresj2/charts` on k3s with images pulled anonymously from
  ghcr.io, passed the same smoke test once the fix above was applied.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-10-03

### Added
- **English portal and console.** Both web apps are now available in English and Portuguese.
  - The first visit follows the browser's language; the **PT · EN** switch (sidebar footer and sign-in page) changes
    it, and the choice is kept in that browser.
  - Content written by people and agents (names, descriptions, conversations, test outputs, audit details) is shown
    as written.
  - Messages generated by the server (API errors, MCP instructions, the composer's recommendation) are still in
    Portuguese.

### Fixed
- The MCP gateway no longer restarts in a loop after Docker stops without a clean shutdown: its proxy removes the
  stale socket left on the volume (`unlink-early`).

### Changed
- Issue forms ask for the install method and the client involved, and a new form covers integration requests
  (clients, harnesses, LLM providers, MCP servers, templates).
- The published images on ghcr.io are now public, except `harness-claude-code`: Claude Code's license does not allow
  redistributing it. `hangar setup` builds that image locally when the coding-harness extra is chosen with published
  images. See [docs/harnesses.md](docs/harnesses.md#the-claude-code-image-is-not-published).

## [0.13.0] — 2026-10-02

### Added
- **Reuse before you build** ([docs/composer.md](docs/composer.md)): new agents are built from existing ones, and
  the existing ones are never changed.
  - `plan_agent` (MCP) / `POST /api/compose/plan` searches the catalog for similar agents, skills, MCPs and templates.
    - It only shows what the person can see, and only agents with a version in production.
    - It says how each agent can enter the new one (`use_as_is`, `specialist` or `base` copy) and whether access is
      needed.
    - It lists the missing skills, with at most 3 questions for the user.
    - Similarity uses the memory service's local multilingual embeddings (cached in the database), with a lexical
      fallback when memory is off.
  - `compose_agent` / `POST /api/compose` creates the new agent from the chosen pieces.
    - Pieces: specialists called as they are, a base copied into the new agent, catalog skills and MCPs, and new
      skills created from the user's answers.
    - The instructions and tests carry only what is new; tests come in from the base and from skills.
    - It records the lineage (`agent_lineage`) and an estimate of tokens reused.
  - Portal: **Novo agente → Reusar antes de construir**, plus "Construído a partir de" and "Usado por" on the agent
    page.
  - Metrics: `GET /api/compose/stats`.
- **Skills as building blocks:** skills now have `examples`, a `test` that runs in the stage tests of every agent
  composed with them, a `version` (raised on every change), a team and an author. Developers can create new skills
  (MCP `register_skill`); only admins change an existing one.
- The memory service exposes `POST /admin/embed` (central only) for the catalog search.

### Fixed
- **Shipping a multi-agent no longer changes its specialists when they are pieces of a composed agent.** Before,
  `ship_agent` re-ran the sub-agents' tests and could publish a sub-agent's unreleased version. Specialists of a
  composed agent are now read-only: they are called on their production version, and they are never tested or
  deployed by the composed agent.
- **Adding a sub-agent requires being allowed to use it** (`design_agent`, `edit_agent`, `PATCH/PUT` on the API).
  Before, a developer could add any visible agent of another team without an approved access request.
- Smoke checks for multi-agents allow 300 s per call; composed agents answer simple questions without calling their
  specialists.

### Upgrading
- Migration `0011_composer` runs on start: new table `agent_lineage`, new columns on `skills`.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-10-01

### Upgrading from 0.11.x
- No migration. New optional chart values (`observability`, `backup`, `externalSecrets`, `serviceAccount`, `postgresql.cloudSqlProxy`); defaults keep the current behavior, except JSON logs and the metrics port in the chart.

### Added
- **Observability** ([docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md)):
  - Prometheus metrics: agent calls, latency, tokens, LLM cost, jobs, HTTP by declared route, one series per replica.
    Served on a separate port (`METRICS_PORT`; `:9100` in the chart) and at `GET /api/metrics` for admins and auditors.
  - JSON logs (`LOG_FORMAT=json`, the chart default) with `trace_id`.
  - OpenTelemetry traces over OTLP (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`): requests, outgoing HTTP calls, and `traceparent`
    propagated to agents.
  - Chart: metrics port, ServiceMonitor, and a Grafana dashboard (ConfigMap for the sidecar).
- **Backup and upgrade** ([docs/backup.md](docs/backup.md)):
  - `hangar backup` and `hangar restore` (Docker, or the chart's Postgres); restore saves the current state first.
  - `hangar upgrade --version`: backup, new images, start, `hangar doctor`.
  - Chart: a daily `pg_dump` CronJob to a volume kept on uninstall, plus a **pre-upgrade backup hook**; if the backup
    fails, the upgrade does not happen.
- **Vault secrets:** `externalSecrets` in the chart (External Secrets Operator: AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret
  Manager, Azure Key Vault, Vault). The chart then generates nothing.
- **Cloud identity:** `serviceAccount.annotations` and `central.podLabels` for GKE Workload Identity, EKS IRSA and
  AKS Workload Identity; the **Cloud SQL Auth Proxy** as a native sidecar (`postgresql.cloudSqlProxy`).
- **Terraform** for GKE, AKS and EKS ([deploy/terraform](deploy/terraform/README.md)): cluster with NetworkPolicy,
  managed Postgres 16 (private, HA, 14-day backups), cloud identity, ingress with TLS, and the chart with 2 replicas.
  `hangar setup --configure-only` finishes the setup without touching the Helm release.
- **Supply chain** ([docs/supply-chain.md](docs/supply-chain.md)):
  - images and chart signed with cosign (keyless), with SBOM and SLSA provenance;
  - CI runs Trivy (image CVEs and chart misconfiguration; the chart scan blocks on CRITICAL/HIGH) and validates the
    Terraform.

### Changed
- Python images apply Debian security updates at build time (the central image goes from 7 HIGH CVEs to 0).
- The chart's Postgres runs with `runAsNonRoot` and a read-only root filesystem.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-10-01

### Added
- **OAuth for the platform MCP** ([docs/clients.md](docs/clients.md#claudeai-and-chatgpt-web-oauth-no-key-to-paste)):
  Claude.ai, ChatGPT and other clients connect by pasting only `<base>/mcp`.
  - Implements the MCP authorization spec: RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata and `WWW-Authenticate` on 401,
    RFC 8414 server metadata, dynamic client registration (RFC 7591), PKCE S256, revocation (RFC 7009).
  - Consent page in the portal (`/app/#/oauth`), after SSO or local sign-in.
  - Tokens: 1-hour access tokens valid only on `/mcp`; rotating refresh tokens with reuse detection.
  - **Minhas chaves → Apps conectados** to revoke; admins see every app and can block one; deactivating a person
    disconnects their apps.
  - Redirect hosts limited by `OAUTH_REDIRECT_HOSTS`; `OAUTH_ENABLED=0` turns it off.
- **High availability on Kubernetes** ([docs/kubernetes.md](docs/kubernetes.md#high-availability)): run 2+ central
  replicas.
  - State that lived in one process now lives in Postgres (table `ephemeral`): job and evaluation callbacks,
    single-use codes, the login lockout; remote-MCP token refreshes are serialized with a database lock.
  - Migrations run under an advisory lock.
  - Jobs record their replica (`worker`); a heartbeat lets surviving replicas close jobs of a replica that died.
  - Chart: `RollingUpdate` with `preStop`, PodDisruptionBudget, anti-affinity, `REPLICA_ID` from the pod name;
    installer question for the number of replicas.

### Fixed
- Image builds retry slow PyPI downloads (`PIP_RETRIES`, `PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`): the Data Studio CI job failed on a
  read timeout.

### Upgrading
- Migration `0010_oauth_ha` runs on start (new tables `ephemeral`, `oauth_clients`, `oauth_grants`; column
  `jobs.worker`). Nothing changes for existing clients.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-10-01

### Upgrading from 0.9.x
- No migration. Docker installs keep working as before; `hangar setup` can now take over an existing `.env` (secrets are kept, the old file is backed up).

### Added
- **Guided installer: `hangar setup`** ([docs/install.md](docs/install.md)), started by `scripts/install.sh` /
  `install.ps1`, which install the CLI in an isolated venv. It asks seven questions:
  - images: published or built from this checkout;
  - exposure: local, Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok or Tailscale Funnel;
  - the admin account;
  - the LLM: a direct provider or a corporate gateway;
  - memory: Neo4j, FalkorDB or none;
  - sign-in: local accounts, Google, Entra ID, GitHub or OAuth2;
  - extras, the code policy and the AI tools to configure.

  Then it writes `.env` (secrets kept, previous file backed up), turns on the profiles via `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, starts
  the stack, registers and tests the LLM, creates the admin, and writes the AI tools' configs to `.hangar/clients/`
  with a personal token.
  - Unattended mode: `--answers setup.yaml` (see `setup.example.yaml`). Re-running it is safe.
- **`hangar doctor`**: checks Docker and containers, the central, admin access, each LLM connection (real call),
  memory, the public address and TLS, sign-in, the platform MCP, the VS Code extension and agents. Each failure comes
  with the fix; it exits with `1` on failure, and `--json` is available.
- **Tunnels as Compose profiles:** `tunnel-cloudflare` (cloudflared), `tunnel-ngrok` and `tunnel-tailscale` (Funnel).
- **LLM connection test:** `POST /api/catalog/llm/{name}/test` and a **Testar** button in the catalog.
- The generic OAuth2 login variables (`OAUTH_OAUTH2_*`) are now passed to the central by `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Kubernetes** ([docs/kubernetes.md](docs/kubernetes.md)):
  - **runtime driver** (`RUNTIME_BACKEND=kubernetes`): each agent is a `Deployment` + `Service` + `Secret`; harness
    runs and code evaluations are `Job`s whose `Secret` is owned by the Job. Pods run as non-root, read-only root
    filesystem (agents), all capabilities dropped, `seccomp: RuntimeDefault`, no service-account token;
  - **Helm chart** `charts/agent-hangar`: namespace-scoped RBAC, NetworkPolicies (agents and jobs reach only the
    central, DNS and the internet minus private ranges), Postgres in the cluster or managed, memory with Neo4j or
    FalkorDB, Ingress (GKE managed certificate, AKS app routing, ALB, cert-manager), Cloudflare Tunnel, secrets
    generated once and kept on upgrades or taken from an existing Secret;
  - **presets** `values-gke.yaml`, `values-aks.yaml`, `values-eks.yaml`, `values-local.yaml`;
  - **`hangar setup --target kubernetes`** writes the values (secrets in a separate 600 file), runs Helm and configures
    the installation through a temporary port-forward; **`hangar doctor --namespace`** checks the pods too;
  - the chart is published as OCI (`oci://ghcr.io/valteresj2/charts/agent-hangar`) with each release; CI lints it and
    renders every preset.

### Fixed
- `/downloads/agent-hangar-vscode.vsix` answers `HEAD` too.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-30

### Upgrading from 0.8.x
- **Migration `0009_code_policy` runs on start.** Nothing changes by default: the company policy starts as `any`.
- **Rebuild or pull `central`, `agent-runtime` and `harness-base`,** which now includes Python 3, pytest and the code
  evaluation runner.
- **Re-ship coding agents** to get secret masking.
- **To use code evaluations,** add test cases with `workspace` (see the `code-assistant` template).

### Added
- **Code evaluations in stage** (test cases with `workspace`, [docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md#code-evaluations-workspace)).
  - A coding agent gets a real mini-project in a throwaway sandbox, with file and terminal tools like a coding
    client. It passes only if `check` exits with 0 and no `protected` file (the tests) changed.
  - Promotion stays blocked until the agent really solves the tasks. In a live run, an agent that edited the test to
    "pass" was failed.
  - The `harness-base` image gains Python 3, pytest and the runner (`eval_runner.js`).
  - The platform MCP tells builders to include these cases for coding agents.
- **Governance for code** ([docs/clients.md](docs/clients.md#coding-agents-in-vs-code-client-tools)).
  - A company `code_policy` (`any` or `approved`) and LLM connections **approved for code**, managed in **Catálogo →
    Conexões de LLM**.
  - With `approved`, the gateway refuses coding mode (`403 code_policy`) on unapproved connections, live and with no
    redeploy. The connection test and code evaluations say why. Plain chat is not affected.
  - Migration `0009_code_policy`.
- **Secret masking in coding mode.** Keys, tokens, private keys, `.env` values, password literals and database URL
  passwords are masked in client tool results before they reach the LLM. Only the value is replaced.
  `llm.redact_secrets: false` turns it off.
- **Template `code-assistant`**: a coding agent with standards and two code evaluations (a bug fix and a feature).

### Fixed
- The runtime answers `400` (not `500`) to a request body that is not UTF-8 JSON.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-30

### Upgrading from 0.7.x
- **No database migrations.**
- **Rebuild or pull `central` and `agent-runtime`, then re-ship the agents** that should work as coding agents. The
  runtime now handles client tools.
- **The central image build needs Node** (a build stage that packages the VS Code extension). The published images
  already include it.

### Added
- **Agents as coding agents in VS Code, Cline, Roo Code and Continue** (client tools,
  [docs/clients.md](docs/clients.md#coding-agents-in-vs-code-client-tools)).
  - The OpenAI-compatible endpoint takes the client's `tools` and returns `tool_calls` for the client to run: files
    and the terminal stay on the developer's machine. The agent's own tools (MCPs, memory, sub-agents) still run on
    the server.
  - If both come in one round, the server part runs first and its context is put back when the client returns its
    results.
  - Works with and without streaming. `llm.client_tools: false` turns it off per agent.
- **Testar conexão** in the Connect tab (`POST /api/agents/{slug}/connections/test`, and the MCP tool
  `test_agent_connection`): an end-to-end check of the coding-agent path, over streaming, with a probe tool.
- New Connect options in model mode: VS Code (coding agent), Cline / Roo Code and Continue.
- **VS Code extension "Agent Hangar"** ([extensions/vscode](extensions/vscode/),
  [docs](docs/clients.md#vs-code-extension-agent-hangar)).
  - The agents you can use appear in the chat's model picker. In Agent mode they edit and test your project with
    VS Code's tools.
  - The extension also registers the platform MCP.
  - One-click sign-in through the portal with PKCE (`/api/vscode/authorize`, `/api/auth/vscode/token`, single-use
    code). Signing out revokes the key.
  - A connection test command, and a `stage` setting to try agents before publishing.
  - The central image builds and tests the `.vsix` and serves it at `/downloads/agent-hangar-vscode.vsix`. The portal
    gets **Baixar extensão** and **Abrir no VS Code** buttons.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-30

### Upgrading from 0.6.x
- **No database migrations.** Rebuild or pull `central` (and `mcp-memory`, if you use memory).
- **Non-admins now land in `/app/`.** Bookmarks to `/ui/` still work: the page redirects them.

### Added
- **User portal (`/app/`) with an Início page** ([docs/access.md](docs/access.md#where-each-person-lands)). One
  screen for everyone who is not an admin:
  - what needs attention (failed tests, a production agent down, failed schedules, recent errors, budgets at
    80%+, requests to decide);
  - your agents, your requests, team budgets and your own usage, upcoming schedules;
  - your connections (keys, with revoke), agent memory, and what's new in the catalog.
  - Backed by `GET /api/me/home`.

### Changed
- **The `/ui/` console is admin-only.** Signed-in non-admins are redirected to the portal.
- The UI's stale-cache reload now runs at most once, so a script error can no longer cause a reload loop.
- **Agent replies render as markdown** (bold, lists, headings) in the Playground and in schedule history. The text
  is escaped first, so no HTML from the model reaches the page.
- **README rewritten.** It has a portal tour (GIF and MP4) and a real end-to-end example: a user asks Claude for an
  agent, it is built, tested, shipped and scheduled through the MCP, and the team uses it.

### Fixed
- **Memory: facts with a future end date count as current.** "On trial until 15/10" still holds today. Graphiti
  marks such facts as expired at ingestion, and they were shown as replaced.
- **Memory: `recall` returns today's date.** The agent can then tell whether a validity window has passed; without
  it, the model guessed.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-09-30

### Upgrading from 0.5.x
- **No database migrations.** Memory lives in its own graph database.
- **Rebuild or pull `central` and `agent-runtime`, then re-ship agents.** Containers now get a per-environment
  token (`INTERNAL_ENV_TOKEN`). Agents that aren't re-shipped are treated as stage when they use memory.
- **Optional profile `memory`:**
  - Run `scripts/setup.sh` or `setup.ps1` again to generate `MEMORY_TOKEN` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD`.
  - Set `MEMORY_URL=http://memory:8000` and `MEMORY_LLM_CONNECTION` in `.env`.
  - Run `docker compose --profile memory up -d`.

  See [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md).

### Added
- **Agent memory (PoC)** ([docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md)): long-term memory as a temporal knowledge graph
  (Graphiti), with Neo4j Community by default (profile `memory`) or FalkorDB (profile `memory-falkordb`).
  - A spec field `memory: {scope: agent|team|org, write}` gives the agent `memory__recall` and `memory__remember`.
  - Writes are asynchronous. Changed facts are invalidated with their dates, not deleted.
  - The central decides the memory groups. Stage reads production memory but writes to its own group, proven by
    a new per-environment container token.
  - Local embeddings (fastembed), so no memory text leaves the network to be vectorized. The extraction LLM
    comes from an encrypted LLM connection.
  - An agent **Memory** tab to browse, search and delete memory, plus a `memory` argument on `design_agent`.
    Deleting an agent deletes its own memory.
  - New image `mcp-memory`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Remote MCPs with OAuth** ([docs/remote-mcp.md](docs/remote-mcp.md)).
  - An admin connects once: discovery (RFC 9728/8414), dynamic client registration, and authorization code with
    PKCE.
  - Tokens are stored encrypted and refreshed automatically.
  - Agents use the MCP through the central's internal proxy (`/internal/mcp-remote/<name>`). Only agents that
    list the MCP in their spec get through, and the provider token never reaches them.
- **Activepieces** (compose profile `activepieces`): 280+ business integrations through its MCP (`ap_run_action`,
  tables, flows). Tested end to end.
- **Docker MCP catalog** (compose profile `mcp-gateway`, [docs/mcp-catalog.md](docs/mcp-catalog.md)): 230+
  prebuilt MCP servers from Docker's official catalog, served by the open-source Docker MCP Gateway (MIT).
  - Admins search and enable servers in **Catálogo → Catálogo Docker MCP**. Credentials are stored encrypted.
  - Each enabled server becomes the catalog MCP `docker:<name>`, and an agent sees only that server's tools
    (new `tool_prefix` on catalog MCPs).
  - Safeguards: signed images; the LLM cannot add servers by itself (`dynamic-tools` disabled); servers run on
    their own network, without agents or the database; Docker is reached only through a restricted proxy.
  - API: `/api/mcp-gateway/catalog`, `/status` and `/servers/{name}`.

### Upgrading from 0.4.x
- **Migrations 0007 and 0008 run on start.** They add the Docker MCP catalog tables and remote MCPs.
- **Rebuild or pull `central` and `agent-runtime`, then re-ship agents** that should use the new MCPs. The
  runtime now filters gateway tools by `tool_prefix` and authenticates to the central's MCP proxy.
- **Optional profiles:**
  - `mcp-gateway` (Docker MCP catalog);
  - `activepieces`. Run `scripts/setup.sh` or `setup.ps1` again to generate its secrets.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Agent schedules.** An agent in production runs by itself at the day and time the user asks for.
  - **Recurrence and time zone:** a cron expression or a one-off date and time, in the company's time zone
    (`PATCH /api/org {"timezone": …}`) or the schedule's own.
  - **MCP:** `schedule_agent`, `list_schedules`, `update_schedule`, `delete_schedule`, `run_schedule_now` and
    `schedule_runs`. The platform guide tells the assistant to schedule when the request includes days and times.
  - **Before production:** a schedule created before the agent goes live waits and starts once the agent is in
    production.
  - **Results:** a run history with the answer, tokens and cost, and an optional webhook (Slack, Teams or HTTP).
  - **Where to find it:** a **Schedules** tab on each agent, *Upcoming scheduled runs* on the dashboard, the API
    (`/api/agents/{slug}/schedules`, `/api/schedules/…`) and the `hangar schedules` CLI.
  - **Safeguards:** only editors can schedule, runs are at least 5 minutes apart, the team budget is respected,
    and webhooks to the internal network are blocked. The scheduler reserves each run with a conditional update,
    so it is safe with several replicas. A run missed while the central was down runs once, marked as `late`.
- **Edit agents later through the MCP** (and the API):
  - `get_agent_spec` shows the current spec and which version runs in production and in stage;
  - `edit_agent` applies changes to the spec and to name, objective, final output and contact as a new
    version, deploys it to stage and runs the tests. Production keeps the previous version. With
    `promote=True` it publishes only if the tests pass, or asks for approval when the role or team requires it;
  - `diff_agent_versions` shows what changed before publishing;
  - `update_agent_access` changes visibility, owner team and exposed spec.
- API: `POST /api/agents/{slug}/edit` and `GET /api/agents/{slug}/diff`.

### Fixed
- Deleting an agent that had schedules, access requests or promotion requests failed on Postgres.
- Elements with the `hidden` attribute could still show when a component set `display`.

### Upgrading from 0.3.x
- **Migration 0006 runs on start.** It adds the schedules and run history, and the company time zone.
- **Set the company time zone** used by default in schedules: `PATCH /api/org {"timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo"}`.
  The default is UTC.
- **The scheduler runs inside the central** (`SCHEDULER_ENABLED=1`). With more than one replica, each run is
  claimed once.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- Text fields that send with Enter (Playground, token login, new team name) blocked typing: only accented letters
  got through. The key handler returned `false` for every other key, which cancels the keystroke. A test now
  guards against this pattern.
- Playground:
  - the send button is disabled while the agent answers, and focus returns to the field;
  - latency, tokens, cost and tools used appear under each answer;
  - errors are highlighted.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-28

### Added
- **Users, teams and roles.**
  - Company roles: admin, auditor and member.
  - Team roles: maintainer, developer and consumer.
  - Every agent belongs to a team. Existing agents move to the default **Plataforma** team.
- **Agent visibility** (`private`, `org`, `open`), with a **company catalog** and **access requests** that a
  maintainer approves. Instructions and spec stay hidden from other teams unless `expose_spec` is on.
- **Production approval (four eyes).**
  - When a developer ships, or when the team requires approval, a pinned promotion request is created.
  - Another maintainer or an admin approves it.
- **Login with OAuth2** (authorization code + PKCE): Google, Microsoft Entra ID, GitHub, and a generic OAuth2
  provider (Keycloak, Okta, Auth0; use Keycloak as the bridge for SAML).
  - Allowed domains, a fixed tenant, and required GitHub organizations.
  - Groups map to teams.
  - `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS`.
- **Local accounts** (username and password, optional with `LOCAL_LOGIN`).
  - Passwords are hashed with scrypt; accounts lock out after 5 failures.
  - Users change their own password; admins reset passwords.
- **SCIM 2.0** (`/scim/v2`): the directory provisions and deactivates users and syncs groups to teams.
- **Sessions.** The UI uses a `HttpOnly` session cookie with CSRF protection instead of a token in
  `localStorage`. "Sign in with token" remains as break-glass access.
- **Keys belong to people.**
  - New scopes `user` (personal token for the CLI and MCP) and `scim`.
  - Keys are revoked automatically when the owner loses access or is deactivated.
- **Monthly budget per team**, with an alert and an optional block (`429` at the gateway).
- Creating a team: a visible **+ Novo time** button (list and team detail) and an optional first maintainer (`maintainer` on `POST /api/teams`).
- UI pages: Aprovações, Times, Usuários, SSO e SCIM; an agent **Acesso** tab; role-aware buttons and tabs.
- CLI: `whoami`, `teams`, `approvals`, `request-access`, `agents ls --mine`, `templates apply --team`.
- Platform MCP: tools act as the key owner. New tools: `whoami`, `request_agent_access`, `list_approvals` and
  `decide_approval`. Catalog writes are admin-only.
- **Plug-and-play tool connections.** A new **Connect** tab on each agent, `hangar connect`, the
  `connect_agent` platform MCP tool and `/api/agents/{slug}/connections`:
  - MCP mode is offered for every tool: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, VS Code, LibreChat,
    Open WebUI, and any other MCP client;
  - model mode is offered for chat tools: LibreChat, Open WebUI, OpenCode, and OpenAI SDKs;
  - each connection is a separate `invoke` key limited to that agent and tagged with the tool, so it can be
    revoked on its own;
  - the config comes ready to paste.
- The gateway tags usage with the key's tool when `X-Channel` is absent.
- Runtime: Open WebUI chat/user headers (`X-OpenWebUI-Chat-Id`) set the session.

### Changed
- **New UI design** following the *Frontend Design* skill (aitmpl.com), with the pre-delivery checklist of
  *UI/UX Pro Max*.
  - **Hangar look:** a tarmac-dark sidebar with grouped navigation (Operação, Construção, Monitoramento,
    Acesso) and a single safety-yellow accent for primary actions, the active item and focus.
  - **Type:** Barlow Semi Condensed for headings, IBM Plex Sans for text, IBM Plex Mono for code.
  - **Screens:** KPIs as one status board, agent rows as flight strips colored by status, and a two-column
    login.
  - **Icons:** SVG icons instead of emojis.
  - **Accessibility:** visible keyboard focus, 44px touch targets, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and dark mode.

### Fixed
- `http://…/ui` without the trailing slash returned 404; `/ui` and `/login` now redirect to the UI, and `/favicon.ico` exists.
- A page left in the browser cache by an older version reloads itself at the current version instead of failing.
- The UI is served with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, and its assets carry a content hash (`app.js?v=…`), so
  browsers never keep an old version after an upgrade.
- Calls through an agent's MCP endpoint now record tokens and cost (the tool result carries `_meta.usage`).
- MCP handshakes, `tools/list` and pings are no longer counted as requests.

### Upgrading from 0.2.x
- **Migrations run on start.** Migration 0004 adds the users, teams and access tables, and 0005 adds local
  accounts. Existing agents move to the default **Plataforma** team with visibility `org`.
- **The UI now opens on a login page.** The first time, use **Entrar com token** with your `ADMIN_TOKEN`. Then
  create people in **Usuários** (SSO, or a local account with username and password) and teams in **Times**.
  You can also set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` to get admin on the first SSO login.
- **Existing keys keep working.** Admin keys and invoke keys, such as the one in LibreChat, are unchanged.
- **Personal tokens for builders.** People who build agents through the platform MCP should switch to a personal
  token (scope `user`), so the client acts with their team roles.
- **Re-ship chat agents** (`hangar ship <slug>`) to get the new runtime: MCP usage with tokens and Open WebUI
  session headers.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-27

### Fixed
- `docker compose up data-studio` now also starts its Docker proxy (`data-studio-docker`); before, container-sandbox
  mode failed on the first kernel start.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-27

### Added
- **Data Studio MCP server** (`mcp-servers/data-studio`, compose profile `data-studio`):
  - a per-conversation workspace, with its own uid and its own stateful Python kernel;
  - DuckDB SQL, and file inspection with OCR;
  - PPTX (native charts) and HTML decks, interactive HTML dashboards, DOCX/HTML reports;
  - URL fetch with an SSRF guard;
  - signed download links.
- **`data-studio` template** and **LibreChat integration kit** (`integrations/librechat`), which uses the agent as
  LibreChat's engine through the OpenAI-compatible gateway.
- Runtime:
  - OpenAI-format attachments (`image_url`, `file`) are saved to the agent's MCP workspace via `ingest_file`;
  - the client conversation id is forwarded to MCPs as `X-Session-Id`;
  - client system prompts are kept;
  - SSE keepalive while tools run;
  - currency `$` is escaped for LaTeX-rendering channels.
- Spec: `llm.max_steps` and `llm.vision`.
- **Live tool progress** streamed as `reasoning_content` (a collapsible "Thoughts" block in LibreChat).
- **Lite mode** (`X-Hangar-Mode: lite`): one short LLM call without tools, used for conversation titles (about 20x
  cheaper). The LibreChat kit routes titles there via `titleEndpoint`.
- Images returned by MCP tools are passed to vision models, so an agent can look at its own output.
- Data Studio:
  - `preview_file` renders PPTX/DOCX/XLSX/PDF with LibreOffice and returns the images to the agent for visual QA;
  - `offline=true` embeds the chart libraries in HTML;
  - compact KPI formats (`R$ 6,26 mi`);
  - workspace retention (`RETENTION_DAYS`);
  - optional **one sandbox container per conversation** (`DATA_STUDIO_SANDBOX=container`).
- The UI "Connect" page shows the full LibreChat config (per-conversation sessions, attachments, titles).
- E2E: attachments flow through the gateway into the MCP workspace; streamed usage is recorded. CI also runs the Data
  Studio smoke test in container-sandbox mode, plus the retention test.
- README demo GIF and screenshots, recorded by `scripts/demo/record_demo.py`.

### Changed
- Postgres moved to an internal `db_net` network that agents can't reach.
- The gateway forwards `X-Conversation-Id`, `X-Session-Id` and `X-User-Id`, allows up to 900 s between stream chunks,
  and records token usage and cost from streamed responses.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-27

First public release (previously an internal prototype called "Central de Agents").

### Added
- Scoped API keys (`admin`, `invoke` limited to specific agents); keys stored as SHA-256 and shown once.
- Per-agent internal tokens (HMAC of the slug): agents can only call their own sub-agents and, if allowed, the
  read-only dashboard. The admin token is never injected into containers.
- Connection API keys encrypted at rest (Fernet, `HANGAR_SECRET_KEY`); existing plaintext keys are migrated on startup.
- Docker access through `docker-socket-proxy` (no socket mounted in the hangar).
- Typed agent spec (Pydantic, JSON Schema at `/api/spec/schema`), JSON Merge Patch updates (`null` deletes),
  full-spec replace, rollback to any version.
- Async harness jobs: queue, cancel, live status/logs over SSE, orphan recovery after restart.
- One Docker image per harness (base/mock, claude-code, codex, deepseek-harness, hermes) with pinned versions;
  DeepSeek Harness telemetry disabled.
- Token usage from harness jobs (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes) and cost in US$ from per-connection prices.
- LLM-as-judge test cases (`judge` rubric); smoke tests include MCP `tools/list`; mock agents skip content checks.
- GitOps: `POST /api/apply` and `hangar apply -f`; template gallery (6 templates) in UI, API, CLI and MCP.
- `hangar` CLI; UI pages for creating agents, spec editor, rollback, templates, API keys, costs, async job playground.
- Alembic migrations (pre-Alembic databases are stamped automatically), pytest suite, E2E smoke script, CI.

### Changed
- Project renamed to **Agent Hangar**; compose project `agent-hangar`, networks `hangar_agents` / `hangar_jobs`.
- The gateway streams SSE responses instead of buffering them; the Docker state of all agents is read in a single call.

### Upgrading from "central-agents"
Stop the old stack without removing volumes, then add these to `.env`:
- `HANGAR_SECRET_KEY` and `INTERNAL_SECRET` (run `scripts/setup.sh`).
- `PGDATA_VOLUME=central-agents_pgdata`.
- `POSTGRES_USER=central` and `POSTGRES_DB=central`.

Then run `docker compose up -d --build` and re-ship your agents (`hangar ship <slug>`) so their containers get
per-agent tokens.
