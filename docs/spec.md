# Agent spec reference

The spec is validated by a strict schema (unknown fields are rejected). The full JSON Schema is served at
`GET /api/spec/schema` and by the MCP tool `get_spec_schema`.

```yaml
llm:                      # chat agents only (mutually exclusive with harness.connection)
  connection: my-litellm  # name of a connection in the catalog (protocol openai); empty = mock
  model: ""               # empty = the connection's default model
  temperature: 0.2
  max_steps: 6            # tool-calling rounds per message (1–40); data agents need 20–30
  vision: true            # false: attached images go only to the workspace (MCP), not to the LLM
  client_tools: true      # false: ignore the `tools` a client sends (default: coding clients' file/terminal tools are used)
  stage: {model: cheap-model}         # optional per-environment overrides: connection / model / temperature

## Code evaluations (`workspace`)

A test case with `workspace` checks that a coding agent really solves a task in a real project, not only that it
answers well. For each case, `run_tests` does the following:
1. It starts a throwaway sandbox container from the `harness-base` image, isolated like harness jobs: no Docker
   socket, memory/CPU/PID limits, the jobs network.
2. The sandbox runner writes `files` and talks to the **stage** version of the agent through a single-use internal
   proxy. It offers the tools a coding client offers: `list_files`, `read_file`, `write_file` and `run_command`
   (bash, 120 s per command).
3. It runs those calls **inside the sandbox**, round by round, up to `max_rounds`.
4. When the agent answers, it runs `check`.

The case passes only if `check` exits with 0 **and** no file in `protected` changed. Protecting the tests means the
agent cannot pass by editing them, and in a live run an agent tempted to do exactly that was failed.

The result lists the rounds, the tools called, the files changed and the tail of the `check` output. It shows up in
the **Testes** tab like any other case. A failed case blocks promotion to production, as usual.

- **Sandbox:** Node 22, Python 3 with pytest, git. `files` can hold up to 200 KB.
- **Where it applies:** chat agents with an LLM connection. Without a connection (mock), the case is reported and
  not run. Harness agents are evaluated by their job result instead.
- **What it costs:** the LLM calls of each case, like a real task.
- **Limitation:** the central tracks running evaluations in memory, so it must run as a single process, as the
  default Compose setup does.

## Updating a spec

- **Merge patch**: `PATCH /api/agents/<slug>` or the MCP tool `design_agent`. This is JSON Merge Patch
  ([RFC 7396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396)): objects merge, lists and scalars replace, and `null`
  deletes. Examples:
  - switch connection and go back to its default model: `{"llm": {"connection": "b", "model": null}}`
  - turn a harness agent into a chat agent: `{"harness": null, "llm": {"connection": "x"}}`
- **Replace**: `PUT /api/agents/<slug>/spec` (the UI's *Spec* editor, and `hangar apply`).
- **Rollback**: `POST /api/agents/<slug>/rollback {"version": 3}`.

## Rules enforced by validation

- A spec cannot set both `llm.connection` and `harness`.
- A harness agent cannot have `sub_agents`.
- Sub-agents must exist, and an agent cannot list itself.
- Catalog references (skills, MCPs, connections) are resolved at deploy time; a missing one fails the deploy
  with a clear message.
