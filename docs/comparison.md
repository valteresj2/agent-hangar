# Agent Hangar vs. agent platforms

Comparison as of October 3, 2026. Versão em português: [comparison.pt-BR.md](comparison.pt-BR.md).

## Summary

Among the sources consulted, Agent Hangar is the only one that combines three things in one self-hosted product:

- a central catalog of agents created in any tool;
- access through four protocols (OpenAI-compatible, MCP, A2A, ACP);
- promotion to production only after stage tests.

The other platforms fall into three groups:

- **Frameworks with a commercial control plane:** CrewAI AMP and LangSmith Deployment (LangGraph). They centralize
  well what was built in their own ecosystem.
- **Visual builder:** Dify. It is strong in workflows and RAG, and publishes apps as an API or an MCP tool.
- **Clouds:** AWS Bedrock AgentCore and Microsoft Foundry with Agent 365. They have a registry and A2A, but inside
  their own cloud.

Watch out for maturity: Agent Hangar is in alpha (v0.15), and the repository does not cite compliance certifications.

## Comparison table

"Not found" means the documentation consulted does not describe the feature; it does not prove the feature is missing.

| Criterion | Agent Hangar | CrewAI AMP | LangSmith Deployment | Dify | AWS Bedrock AgentCore | Microsoft Foundry + Agent 365 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What it is | Self-hosted control plane for agents from any source | Commercial control plane of the CrewAI framework | Agent runtime (Agent Server) with observability and evaluation | Visual platform for LLM apps, agents and RAG | AWS services: Runtime, Gateway and Registry | Azure managed service, with the registry in Agent 365 |

| Agents made in Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Codex go to one catalog | Yes, that is the focus: the tool creates the agent through the hangar's MCP | Partial: an MCP server exposes AMP deploy operations to clients such as Claude | Partial: deploys LangGraph, Deep Agents and other frameworks | Not found | Yes, for MCP, A2A and agent cards synced by URL (preview) | Partial: agents from Foundry, Copilot Studio and registered by an admin |

| Portability and lock-in | Low: YAML spec with JSON Schema, GitOps (`hangar apply`), standard endpoints, self-hosted | Medium: framework code is portable; the managed deploy belongs to AMP | Medium: LangGraph is open and there is a standalone Agent Server with Docker; the full platform is Enterprise | Medium: apps export as YAML DSL; self-hosted available | Open protocols (MCP, A2A), but the runtime and Registry stay on AWS | Accepts any framework and A2A, but hosting and registry stay on Azure and Microsoft 365 |
| Agents combined into new agents | Yes: `sub_agents` over A2A, with permission checks | Yes: crews, the core of the framework | Yes: RemoteGraph through MCP and A2A | Yes: workflows with chained agents | Yes: A2A between agents | Yes: A2A tool |

## LLMs: what each platform allows

In Agent Hangar the model belongs to the agent, not to the platform. Each agent points to a connection (URL, model and
encrypted key), which can change per environment and records cost in US$. What each platform makes possible:

- **Agent Hangar:**
  - switch an agent's model without recreating it;
  - use different models in stage and production;
  - run a local model with Ollama;
  - reach Bedrock and Vertex through a corporate gateway;
  - use coding harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, DeepSeek Harness) as agents.
- **CrewAI AMP:** pick the model per agent in code, with several providers and the Azure and Bedrock integrations
  listed in the framework's changelog.
- **LangSmith Deployment:** the model comes from the agent's framework. The runtime hosts what LangGraph or another
  framework already defines; the sources consulted show no model catalog of its own.
- **Dify:** install model providers from the Marketplace and switch the model of an app or workflow on the canvas.
- **AWS AgentCore:** the Gateway is described as an access point to tools, other agents and LLMs; the sources
  consulted do not list the supported models.
- **Microsoft Foundry:** choose from a [catalog of 10,000+ models](https://atlan.com/know/ai-agent/microsoft/azure-ai-foundry/),
  with a single entry point for inference and tools.

## Where Agent Hangar stands apart

Agents stop belonging to the tool that created them and start belonging to the company. Five points support this:

- **It builds where people already work.** The hangar is an MCP server: Claude, ChatGPT, Codex or OpenCode create the
  agent. Claude.ai and ChatGPT on the web connect with just the URL, through OAuth.
- **Nothing reaches production untested.** Every change is an immutable version. Promotion requires stage tests
  (smoke, regex and LLM-as-judge), with optional approval by a second maintainer and a one-call rollback.
- **Isolation per agent.** Each agent runs in a hardened container. Coding harnesses (Claude Code, Codex) run in a
  fresh container per call and return the result and the git diff.
- **Memory and cost are part of the platform.** Temporal memory per agent, team or organization, and a monthly budget
  per team with an optional cutoff.
- **Bring your own LLM gateway.** The hangar hosts no model; it uses LiteLLM, OpenRouter or a provider through
  connections with encrypted keys.

## Where the others are still ahead

The comparison is only honest if it shows where Agent Hangar loses today:

- **Maturity and compliance.** Dify Enterprise advertises SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001, and the Community edition has
  more than 157,000 stars. Agent Hangar is in alpha, and the README recommends running it inside your network until
  you have read the security documentation.
- **Observability and evaluation.** In LangSmith, traces and evaluation are the core product. Agent Hangar provides
  metrics, logs and OpenTelemetry, but without that documented depth.
- **Native cloud integration.**
  - Agent 365 distributes agents in Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot.
  - AgentCore applies IAM and Cedar policies in the Gateway.
- **Visual building.** Dify has a drag-and-drop canvas; Agent Hangar builds through conversation, templates or YAML.
- **Open roadmap.** Slack and Teams adapters and egress allow-lists for jobs are still next steps.
