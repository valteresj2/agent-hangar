# Installing on Kubernetes (GKE, AKS, EKS)

Agent Hangar ships a Helm chart (`charts/agent-hangar`) and a Kubernetes runtime driver: each agent becomes a
`Deployment` + `Service`, each harness run or code evaluation becomes a `Job`. The same guided installer used for
Docker (`hangar setup`) drives the chart, so the questions and the result are the same: the LLM registered and
tested, the admin created and your AI tools configured.

## 1. Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Cluster | Kubernetes **1.27+** (GKE, AKS, EKS, or any conformant cluster: k3s, kind, Docker Desktop…) |
| Tools | `kubectl` pointing at the cluster (`kubectl config current-context`), **Helm 3.12+**, Python 3.10+ |
| Permissions | create a namespace and, inside it, Deployments, Jobs, Services, Secrets, Roles and NetworkPolicies |
| Nodes | 4 vCPU / 8 GB for the base install; each agent asks for up to 512 MiB / 1 vCPU (configurable) |
| Network | Outbound HTTPS to your LLM provider and to `ghcr.io` (or your mirror) |
| NetworkPolicy | a CNI that enforces it — see [the table below](#networkpolicy) |

## 2. Run the installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valteresj2/agent-hangar && cd agent-hangar
./scripts/install.sh --target kubernetes          # Windows: scripts\install.ps1 --target kubernetes
```

If the CLI is already installed, `hangar setup --target kubernetes` does the same. The installer asks:

| Question | Choices |
|---|---|
| Cloud / cluster | `gke` · `aks` · `eks` · `local` — picks the preset `values-<provider>.yaml` |
| Namespace and release | default `agent-hangar` / `agent-hangar` |
| Image registry | `ghcr.io/valteresj2` or your private mirror |
| Access | **Ingress with TLS** (host + cert-manager issuer when needed) · **Cloudflare Tunnel** (no load balancer) · port-forward only (testing) |
| Postgres | in the cluster (StatefulSet) · **managed** (Cloud SQL, Azure Database, RDS/Aurora) |
| Private egress | whether agents may reach private IPs (e.g. an LLM gateway inside your network) |
| Then | the same questions as Docker: admin, LLM, memory (Neo4j/FalkorDB), sign-in, code policy, AI tools |

What it does:
1. writes `.hangar/values.yaml` (choices, no secrets) and `.hangar/secrets.values.yaml` (mode 600, git-ignored);
2. runs `helm upgrade --install … --wait` with the preset of your cloud;
3. opens a temporary `kubectl port-forward` to the central and, through the API, registers and tests the LLM,
   creates the admin, and writes your AI tools' configs to `.hangar/clients/`;
4. prints the public address.

Unattended: `hangar setup --target kubernetes --answers setup.yaml` (see the `kubernetes:` block in
[`setup.example.yaml`](../setup.example.yaml)).

Re-running is safe: previous answers are the defaults and the generated secrets (`adminToken`, `secretKey`,
`internalSecret`, Postgres password) are reused. **Never change `secretKey` after installing**: it decrypts the LLM
keys stored in the database. Keep a copy of `.hangar/secrets.values.yaml` in your secret manager.

## 3. Check it

```bash
hangar doctor --namespace agent-hangar
```

It checks the pods (installation and agents), then everything `doctor` checks on Docker — central, admin, each LLM
with a real call, memory, the public address and TLS, sign-in, MCP and the VS Code extension — through a temporary
port-forward. Run from the same folder as the setup, `--namespace` is not needed.

## 4. Per cloud

### Google GKE

```bash
gcloud container clusters create-auto agent-hangar --region southamerica-east1   # Autopilot includes Dataplane V2
gcloud compute addresses create agent-hangar-ip --global                         # point your DNS host at it
```

- **Ingress:** GKE Ingress with a Google-managed certificate (`values-gke.yaml` creates the `ManagedCertificate`).
  Issuing the certificate takes 15–60 min after the DNS points to the IP.
- **Database:** Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL with a private IP in the cluster's VPC; answer *managed* and give
  `postgresql+psycopg://hangar:PASSWORD@PRIVATE_IP:5432/hangar`.
- **Vertex AI:** run a gateway (LiteLLM) with Workload Identity and register it as a *corporate gateway* connection.

### Azure AKS

```bash
az aks create -g rg-hangar -n agent-hangar --network-plugin azure --network-policy cilium --network-dataplane cilium
az aks approuting enable -g rg-hangar -n agent-hangar                             # managed NGINX ingress
```

- **TLS:** cert-manager with a `ClusterIssuer` (the installer asks for its name), or a Key Vault certificate via the
  `kubernetes.azure.com/tls-cert-keyvault-uri` annotation.
- **Database:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Flexible Server with private access;
  `...@<server>.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/hangar?sslmode=require`.
- **Azure OpenAI:** an OpenAI-compatible connection `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1` (model = deployment).

### Amazon EKS

```bash
eksctl create cluster -n agent-hangar --region sa-east-1 --with-oidc
# add-ons: AWS Load Balancer Controller, EBS CSI driver (gp3), VPC CNI with enableNetworkPolicy=true
```

- **Ingress:** ALB with an ACM certificate: set `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn` in your values and point
  Route 53 to the ALB.
- **Database:** RDS / Aurora PostgreSQL in the same VPC; `...@<endpoint>.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/hangar?sslmode=require`.
- **Bedrock:** a gateway (LiteLLM) with IRSA or Pod Identity, registered as a *corporate gateway* connection.

### Other clusters (k3s, kind, Docker Desktop, on-premises)

Choose `local`. Use Ingress with your controller (`ingress.className`) and cert-manager, a Cloudflare Tunnel, or
port-forward only.

## 5. Security model

- **Agents and jobs** run as non-root (uid 10001), read-only root filesystem (agents), all capabilities dropped,
  `seccomp: RuntimeDefault`, no service-account token.
- **RBAC:** the central's ServiceAccount has a namespace-scoped `Role` (Deployments, Services, Jobs, Pods, logs,
  Secrets in its own namespace). Nothing cluster-wide.
- **Secrets:** agent environment (LLM tokens, connection keys) lives in a per-agent `Secret`; job secrets have an
  `ownerReference` to the Job and are deleted with it.

### NetworkPolicy

Agents, jobs and evaluations can reach only the central (port 8080), DNS and the internet **minus private ranges**
(10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 169.254/16, 100.64/10 — which blocks Postgres, memory and cloud metadata). Set
`networkPolicy.allowPrivateEgress=true` (installer question) if they must reach an internal LLM gateway.

Policies only take effect if the CNI enforces them:

| Cloud | How |
|---|---|
| GKE | Dataplane V2 (default on Autopilot; `--enable-dataplane-v2` on Standard) |
| AKS | `--network-policy azure`, `calico` or `cilium` |
| EKS | VPC CNI add-on with `enableNetworkPolicy=true`, or Calico/Cilium |
| Others | Calico, Cilium (k3s enforces them by default) |

## 6. Air-gapped / private registry

Mirror the images (`central`, `agent-runtime`, `harness-*`, `mcp-memory`) to your registry, answer its address in
the installer and, if it needs credentials, create a pull secret and set it in your values:

```yaml
image:
  registry: registry.acme.com/agent-hangar
  pullSecrets: [regcred]
```

## 7. Helm without the installer

```bash
helm upgrade --install agent-hangar charts/agent-hangar -n agent-hangar --create-namespace \
  -f charts/agent-hangar/values-gke.yaml -f my-values.yaml
```

The chart is also published as OCI with each release:
`helm install agent-hangar oci://ghcr.io/valteresj2/charts/agent-hangar --version <x.y.z>`.

The chart generates the secrets on the first install and keeps them on upgrades (the Secret has
`helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`); to manage them yourself, set `secrets.existingSecret`. All options are documented
in [`values.yaml`](../charts/agent-hangar/values.yaml). After installing, register the LLM and the admin in the console
(`/ui/`, sign in with the emergency token printed by `helm status`) or run `hangar setup --target kubernetes`.

## High availability

Run two or more central replicas: answer the installer's *replicas* question, or set `central.replicas: 2` (or more).
- **Rolling updates** with no downtime (`maxUnavailable: 0`, a `preStop` pause so a pod leaves the Service before
  stopping), a **PodDisruptionBudget** (`central.pdb.minAvailable`), and replicas spread across nodes.
- **Shared state** lives in Postgres: job and evaluation callbacks, single-use codes (OAuth, VS Code), the login
  lockout and remote-MCP token refreshes work whichever replica receives them. Migrations run under a database lock,
  so replicas can start together.
- **Jobs** record the replica running them. A restarted replica recovers only its own jobs; jobs of a replica that
  disappears (no heartbeat for 75 s) are closed by the others within about a minute.
- Use a **managed Postgres with HA** (Cloud SQL, Azure Database, RDS/Aurora): the bundled StatefulSet is a single pod.

Validated on k3s with 2 replicas: concurrent start (one migration), harness jobs whose callbacks land on the other
replica, OAuth codes exchanged across replicas (single use), the login lockout shared, and a rolling restart under
continuous traffic with no failed request.

## Limits of this release

- Tested end to end on k3s; the GKE/AKS/EKS presets follow each provider's documentation. Please report differences.
- Optional Compose extras (Data Studio, Docker MCP catalog, Activepieces) are not part of the chart yet.
