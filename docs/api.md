# HTTP API

Interactive OpenAPI docs: `GET /docs`. Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or
`X-API-Key: <token>`. The token is an admin key, a personal token (scope `user`) or a session token.
The browser UI uses the session cookie and must send `X-CSRF-Token` (the value of the `hangar_csrf` cookie) on
writes.

Every route below checks the caller's permission on the resource ([access.md](access.md)). Lists are filtered to
what the caller can see. Admins see everything.

## Login and session (`/api/auth`, open)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/auth/providers` | Configured login providers |
| GET | `/api/auth/login/{provider}?next=#/…` | Redirects to Google, Microsoft, GitHub or generic OAuth2 (authorization code + PKCE) |
| GET | `/api/auth/callback/{provider}` | Provider callback; opens the session and redirects to the UI |
| POST | `/api/auth/token` | `{token}` → session cookie (ADMIN_TOKEN, admin key or personal token) |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Ends the session |
| GET | `/api/me` | Who am I: company role, teams, pending approvals |

## Company, teams, users, approvals

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET / PATCH | `/api/org` | Company name, default visibility, time zone and `code_policy` (`any` \| `approved`) (PATCH: admin) |
| GET / POST | `/api/teams` | List (with spend and your role) / create `{name, description?, require_approval?, maintainer?}` (admin) |
| GET / PATCH / DELETE | `/api/teams/{team}` | Detail / name, description (maintainer), `require_approval`, `budget_usd_month`, `budget_enforce` (admin) / delete (admin, no agents) |
| GET / POST | `/api/teams/{team}/members` | Members / add `{email, role}` (maintainer; pre-registers unknown e-mails) |
| PATCH / DELETE | `/api/teams/{team}/members/{user_id}` | Change role / remove |
| GET / POST / PATCH | `/api/users`, `/api/users/{id}` | List (auditor) / pre-register / role and `active` (admin; deactivating revokes sessions and keys) |
| GET | `/api/approvals` | What you can decide now, and your own requests |
| POST | `/api/promotions/{id}/approve` · `/reject` | Production approval (the requester cannot approve) |
| POST | `/api/agents/{slug}/access-requests` | `{reason}` request to use an agent of another team |
| GET | `/api/agents/{slug}/grants` | Pending and approved access (maintainer) |
| POST | `/api/access-requests/{id}/approve` · `/reject` · `/revoke` | Decide or revoke (revoking also revokes the person's keys) |
| PATCH | `/api/agents/{slug}/access` | `{visibility, expose_spec, team}` (maintainer) |
| GET | `/api/sso` | Providers, group mappings, SCIM URL (admin) |
| PUT | `/api/sso/{provider}` | `{enabled, client_id, client_secret, settings}` (secret encrypted) |
| POST / DELETE | `/api/sso/mappings`, `/api/sso/mappings/{id}` | Group → team `{provider, external_group, team, role}` |

## Schedules (`/api`)

A scheduled agent runs by itself in production at the chosen day and time. Creating, changing and deleting a
schedule requires the right to edit the agent. Team members can see schedules and their runs.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET / POST | `/api/agents/{slug}/schedules` | List / create `{message, cron? \| run_at?, timezone?, name?, notify_url?}` |
| GET | `/api/schedules` | Every schedule you can see |
| PATCH / DELETE | `/api/schedules/{id}` | Change time, message or webhook; pause or resume with `enabled` / delete |
| POST | `/api/schedules/{id}/run` | Run now and wait for the result |
| GET | `/api/schedules/{id}/runs` | History: status, answer, tokens, cost, webhook delivery |

- **`cron`:** five fields (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week) in the schedule's time zone.
  Examples: `0 9 * * 1-5` runs on weekdays at 09:00, and `0 8 5 * *` runs on the 5th at 08:00. Aliases such as
  `@daily` work too.
- **`run_at`:** a one-off run, for example `2026-10-05T09:00`.
- **Time zone:** defaults to the company's, set with `PATCH /api/org {"timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo"}`.
- **When it runs:** only while the agent is in production. A schedule created earlier waits, and takes effect
  when the agent goes live.
- **`notify_url`:** receives `{text, agent, schedule, status, output, …}`, a payload that works with Slack and
  Teams incoming webhooks.
- **Limits:** runs at least 5 minutes apart, and webhooks to the internal network are blocked.

## Remote MCPs with OAuth (`/api/remote-mcps`, admin)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET / POST | `/api/remote-mcps` | List / start a connection `{name, url, description?, browser_base?}` → `{authorize_url}` |
| GET | `/api/remote-mcps/callback` | OAuth redirect target (stores the tokens, creates the catalog MCP) |
| POST | `/api/remote-mcps/{name}/test` | List the tools with the stored token |
| DELETE | `/api/remote-mcps/{name}` | Revoke and remove |

Agents reach the MCP at `/internal/mcp-remote/{name}` with their internal token. See [remote-mcp.md](remote-mcp.md).

## VS Code extension

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/vscode/authorize` | Portal (signed-in user): `{challenge, state, device}` → a signed, single-use `code` (5 min) and the `vscode://` redirect |
| POST | `/api/auth/vscode/token` | Extension (open route): `{code, verifier}` (PKCE) → personal key `{token, key_id, user}`, scope `user`, client `vscode-ext` |
| GET | `/downloads/agent-hangar-vscode.vsix` | The extension package, built with the central image |

## OAuth for the platform MCP (Claude.ai, ChatGPT…)

Discovery and token endpoints are open (CORS enabled); the consent and management routes need a signed-in user.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource[/mcp]` | RFC 9728 metadata. `/mcp` without a token answers 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"` |
| GET | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | RFC 8414 metadata (also at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`) |
| POST | `/oauth/register` | Dynamic client registration (RFC 7591): public clients only (`token_endpoint_auth_method=none`); redirect hosts limited by `OAUTH_REDIRECT_HOSTS`; 30 registrations/hour per IP |
| GET | `/oauth/authorize` | Validates the request (PKCE S256 required) and sends the browser to the portal consent page `/app/#/oauth` |
| POST | `/oauth/token` | `authorization_code` (+ `code_verifier`) or `refresh_token` (rotating; reusing an old one revokes the authorization) |
| POST | `/oauth/revoke` | RFC 7009: revokes the authorization owning the token |
| GET / POST | `/api/oauth/consent` | Portal: request details / `{params, approve}` → `{redirect}` back to the app with `code` and `state` |
| GET / DELETE | `/api/me/oauth[/{id}]` | Connected apps of the caller (admins: everyone's) / revoke one |
| GET / DELETE | `/api/oauth/clients[/{client_id}]` | Admin: registered apps / block an app and all its authorizations |

## Reuse before you build (`/api/compose`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/compose/plan` | `{request, capabilities?, limit?}` → similar agents (only visible, only in production), skills, MCPs, templates, access per piece, gaps and questions, `compose_hint` |
| POST | `/api/compose` | Creates a NEW agent from pieces: `specialists`, `base`, `skills`, `new_skills`, `mcps`, `copy_tests_from`, plus only the new `instructions`/`tests`. Source agents are never changed |
| GET | `/api/agents/{slug}/lineage` | `built_from` (base, specialists with versions and whether they changed since) and `used_by` |
| GET | `/api/compose/stats` | Admins and auditors: plans, composed agents, reuse rate, tokens reused vs written |

## Agent guide (`/api/agents/{slug}/guide`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/agents/{slug}/guide` | Anyone who can see the agent: `facts` (goal, versions, model, pieces, example requests, endpoints when the caller can use it), `graph` (`nodes`, `edges` of the flow) and `doc` (`text`, `source`, `reviewed`, `version`, `outdated`) |
| PUT | `/api/agents/{slug}/guide` | Editors: `{text}` in Markdown. It creates no new agent version and needs no tests |
| POST | `/api/agents/{slug}/guide/approve` | Editors: marks the generated draft as reviewed |
| POST | `/api/agents/{slug}/guide/generate` | Editors: new draft from the agent's LLM, written only from the spec and the passed tests |

See [guide.md](guide.md). MCP tools: `get_agent_guide`, `set_agent_guide`.

## Digital employee API

## Gateway (`/gw/<slug>`: invoke key for that agent, a user who can use it, or admin)

`/gw/<slug>/…` = prod, `/gw-stage/<slug>/…` = stage.

| Protocol | Path |
|---|---|
| OpenAI-compatible | `POST v1/chat/completions` (`stream: true` supported), `GET v1/models` |
| A2A | `GET .well-known/agent.json` (also `agent-card.json`), `POST a2a` (`message/send`) |
| ACP | `GET acp/agents`, `POST acp/runs` |
| MCP | `POST mcp` (Streamable HTTP, stateless, JSON responses) |

Optional header `X-Channel: <name>` tags usage for per-channel metrics. Without it, a key created by a tool
connection tags usage with its tool (`claude-code`, `open-webui`, …); other keys fall back to `api`.

## Platform MCP (`/mcp`, admin key, personal token or OAuth token)

The client acts with the key owner's roles. The tools are:

- **Guidance:** `platform_guide`, `get_spec_schema`, `whoami`.
- **Access:** `request_agent_access`, `list_approvals`, `decide_approval`.
- **Schedules:** `schedule_agent`, `list_schedules`, `update_schedule`, `delete_schedule`, `run_schedule_now`, `schedule_runs`.
- **Catalog:** `list_catalog`, `register_llm_connection`, `register_skill`, `register_mcp_server`.
- **Templates:** `list_templates`, `apply_template`.
- **Build:** `register_agent`, `design_agent` (merge patch plus `remove`), `rollback_agent`, `build_multi_agent`.
- **Inspect:** `list_agents`, `get_agent`, `get_agent_spec` (spec, plus which version runs in prod and in stage).
- **Edit later:** `edit_agent` (changes, then stage and tests, then publish when `promote=True`), `diff_agent_versions`, `update_agent_access`.
- **Test and deploy:** `run_tests`, `deploy_stage`, `promote_to_production`, `ship_agent`, `stop_agent`.
- **Use:** `chat_with_agent`, `run_harness_job` (`wait`), `get_job`, `cancel_job`, `create_consumer_key`,
  `connect_agent` (per-tool key + ready-to-paste config).

## Internal (`/internal`, called from containers only)

These routes are:

- `POST /internal/jobs/{id}/callback`, authenticated by the job token.
- `/internal/gw/…`, used for agent → sub-agent calls.
- `GET /internal/dashboard/*`, a read-only view for agents with `platform_dashboard`.
- `POST /internal/gate`, called by a Digital employee's runtime before every tool call: `{task_id, tool, ref, args,
  rationale, kind}` returns `allowed`, `waiting` (with `request_id`) or `denied`.

The last three are authenticated by `X-Agent-Slug` plus that agent's HMAC token.
